## Welcome to APAC Blocks

The APAC region is home to many interesting people and projects in the blockchain field, but is often overlooked on the international stage.

The idea behind APAC Blocks is to:
- Highlight competent people and projects solving real problems,
- Raise the general standards of blockchain-literacy,
- Enable peer-discovery of high signal to noise ratio people.

### Membership Protocol and Fees

All members can invite **two** new members. New members can only join the organisation while in **physical attendance** at an APAC Blocks event. Join the telegram group (@apacblocks) to be made aware of upcoming events.

Any 6 members can create an official event. To join as a new member, please go to [https://members.apacblocks.org](https://members.apacblocks.org) while physically at an event.

### Token

The organisation shall have an associated shitcoin which will be initially distributed at the Genesis event ([Launch Party](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apac-blockchain-association-launch-party-tickets-70731219983)). Protocol rules for this token (such as inflation rate etc) are decided programmatically by on-chain voting.
