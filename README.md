## Welcome to APAC Blocks

The APAC region is home to many interesting people and projects in the blockchain field, but is often overlooked on the international stage.

The idea behind APAC Blocks is to:
- Highlight competent people and projects solving real problems,
- Raise the general standards of blockchain-literacy,
- Enable peer-discovery of high signal to noise ratio people.
