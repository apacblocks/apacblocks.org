## Welcome to APAC Blocks

The APAC region is home to many interesting people and projects in the blockchain field, but is often overlooked on the international stage.

The idea behind APAC Blocks is to:
- Highlight competent people and projects solving real problems,
- Raise the general standards of blockchain-literacy,
- Enable peer-discovery of high signal to noise ratio people.

### Genesis party
The genesis party will be held on Friday the 6th of September in Hong Kong.
Please register [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apac-blockchain-association-launch-party-tickets-70731219983) if you wish to attend, as numbers are limited. The code for a free ticket is the first 17 letters of the Bitcoin genesis headline.

### Membership Protocol and Fees

New members can only join the organisation while in physical attendance at an APAC Blocks event.

The first 88 memberships are free. Any member can invite a maximum of two new members - membership is by invitation only. When the 88th person has joined as a member, an on-chain state change will be triggered giving all members the ability the vote on what (if any) membership fee should be charged. 

### Token

The organisation shall have an associated shitcoin which will be initially distributed at the Genesis event ([Launch Party](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apac-blockchain-association-launch-party-tickets-70731219983)). Protocol rules for this token (such as inflation rate etc) are decided programmatically by on-chain voting.
